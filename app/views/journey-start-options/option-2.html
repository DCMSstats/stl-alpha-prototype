      Apply online to register a new property as a short-term let in England
    </h1>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Short-term letting is when a residential property is rented out (or let)
      for a period of less than 90 nights.
    </p>

        <span class="govuk-visually-hidden">Warning</span>
        You now need to register any short-term let property you operate, by
        law. If you let out your property without registering it, you could get
        a fine of up to £2,500.

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Registration includes confirming that you are complying with the necessary
      regulations.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Once registered, you will receive a registration number and digital badge
      that you can display when advertising your property. The requirement to
      register short-term let properties will ensure that all short-term let
      operators know about, and meet, the required safety and planning
      regulations.
