# Short-term Lets Prototype

This is a prototype of the Short-term lets service which is being developed by the DCMS Visitor Economy Team.

The project is currently in an alpha stage so designs here are likely to change before the service is live, and are currently being used for user research.

# How to use and run this prototype

You will need:

- A code editor (like VSCode)
- Node.js (The kit is designed to work with Node.js version 20 and above.)
- To have cloned this repository and saved it in a folder on your local machine.

## View the site and edit locally

In the terminal, enter:

`git clone git@github.com:DCMSstats/stl-alpha-prototype.git`

`cd stl-alpha-prototype`

`npm run dev`

The first time you run `npm run dev`, the kit will ask you whether you want to send anonymous data to help the team improve the service. Enter `y` or `n` to answer yes or no.

In your web browser, go to [open http://localhost:3000 (opens in a new tab).](http://localhost:3000/)

To quit the kit, in the terminal press the `ctrl` and `c` keys together.
