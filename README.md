Setup to run the kit
====================
test

To run the kit, you will need:
- A code editor (like VSCode)
- Node.js (The kit is designed to work with Node.js version 20 and above.)
- To have cloned this repository and saved it in a folder on your local machine.

How to run the kit
==================

You'll use the terminal to start and stop the kit.

Open the prototype folder in terminal
-------------------------------------

If you're following the guide to getting started you'll already have the terminal open in the right folder.

If you're coming back to work on a prototype, you'll need to navigate to the folder:

`cd ~/Documents/prototypes/stl-alpha-prototype`

Run the kit
-----------

In the terminal, enter:

`npm run dev`

The first time you run `npm run dev`, the kit will ask you whether you want to send anonymous data to help the team improve the service. Enter `y` or `n` to answer yes or no.

In your web browser, go to [open http://localhost:3000 (opens in a new tab).](http://localhost:3000/)

Quitting the kit
----------------

It's fine to leave the kit running for days or while your computer is asleep.

To quit the kit, in the terminal press the `ctrl` and `c` keys together.
